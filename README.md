# Bro≈Ñ Vault

Bro≈Ñ Vault is an open-source stealer logs dashboard designed to simplify the process of analyzing stealer log data. 

> üí° If you're new to this concept, we recommend reading our introductory article on our blog: ['Stealer Logs: Perspectives on Attack and Defense in a Silent Epidemic, and How Bro≈Ñ Vault Automates the Parsing Process'](https://blog.intellibron.io/stealer-logs-perspectives-on-attack-and-defense-in-a-silent-epidemic-and-how-bron-vault-automates-the-parsing-process/).

Forget complex ad-hoc scripts. With Bro≈Ñ Vault, you can simply drag and drop `.zip` log files into the web interface. The application automatically parses the data and presents it in a structured format, ready for inspection.

Our goal is to support the day-to-day needs of security teams on the front lines by providing a practical alternative to manual scripting or overly complex platforms typically required for stealer log analysis. This project reflects our mission to democratize security, making foundational analysis capabilities accessible to everyone and allowing analysts to focus on critical decision-making instead of manual log parsing.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This tool was developed as a side project and is not intended for production use. Please see the [Important Notice](#-important-notice) section below.
